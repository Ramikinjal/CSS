                <h3>Defult Setup</h3>
                <p>Default setup of flex properties is flex: 0 1 auto.That's shortahand for
                    flex-grow,flex-shrink,and flex-basis properties values. </p>
                <p>This setup basically tells us: "All the flex children <b>should not grow,should shrink</b> at the
                    same
                    rate, and have their <b>intialsize based on their width or height."</b></p>

                <h5>Frist card</h5>
                <p>On the other hand,We denounce with righteous indignation and dislike men who are so beguiled and
                    demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the moment,so blinded by desire,that they cannot foresee
                    the pain and trouble that are bound to ensue;and equal blame belongs to those who fail in their duty
                    through weakness of will,which is the same as saying through shrinking from toil and pain.</p>

                <h5>Third card</h5>
                <p>But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations of business it will
                    frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted.</p>
